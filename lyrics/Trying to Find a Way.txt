There's a place I have seen
When I'm lost in my dreams
Where nights are as bright as the day

It's not very far
From wherever you are
Can you help me
'Cause I'm trying to find a way
---
Got the path in my head from
That trail of breadcrumbs
So how come that lead me astray?

But lately I fear
You can't get there from here
So where do I go
If I'm trying to find a way?
---
[Br]
I've walked through the fire on the edge of a knife
Will I wander this desert for the rest of my life?
There's nowhere I can stay
Heaven help me!
Lord, I'm trying to find a way

---

I'd sleep through the day
if it took me away


---
[Final Br]

everyone said there's no way
... pray
Heaven help me!
Lord, I'm trying to find a way
