Mama how'd you do it
How did you and Dad survivie?
How did you afford to feed
This hungry family of five?

[ch]
Did you know when to stop and where to go?
And did you know where the river path would flow?
And winds would blow, so I'd reap the seeds you've sewn?
How'd you have known of all the fruits upon our family tree?



---
Grandma how'd you do it?
How could you just leave your home?
Leave your family and friends behind
And venture out alone?

---

Grandpa how'd you do it?
How did you survive the war?


[ch]

Great Grandma how'd you do it?
How did you know where to go?

---

Great Grandpa how'd you do it?
How did you convince your wife
That you had to leave the land you planned
to live on all your life?

Take a boat and cross the ocean
Where you've never been before
Did you know what your new life would have in store?




[outtro]
And how it's grown with all the fruits upon our family tree
I'm not alone with all the fruits upon our family tree
