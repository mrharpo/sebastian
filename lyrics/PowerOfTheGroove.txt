That's the power of the Groove


Listen up!
Who's got all the power? Every hour of the day?
Who's in control of if I'm stiff or if I sway?



Make a kid jump up
Make a king sit down
Make you turn around
That's the power of the Groove


Make an old man dance
Make a young man cry
Makes me wonder why
That's the power of the Groove




Even if you never heard
Even if you don't know the words
It's true -
That's the power of the Groove!
