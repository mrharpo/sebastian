Feelin' down? Feelin' out? Feelin' beat? Feelin' brusised?
Sit back! Feel relaxed. Go on and kick off your shoes.

Feelin' life went up and left you down in 
I got a happy little secret that I want you to know


If you can feel the beat that means you're ready to rock

Keep thrivin', keep strivin, keep it up, don't stop
You gotta fake it 'till you make it up top

[ch]
So put your hands up in the air!
And wave them all around like you just don't care!
'Cause if you really didn't care
You wouldn't put your hands up in the air!
