[ch]
Where have my blue skies all gone?
Where did the dark clouds come from?
When will my blue days see new rays of sunshine?

When did my light turn into grey?
How did it all just fade away?
Give me a reason this season will break in my mind.


[v1]
I started to shout
But I can't get it out
I'm not in control of where I go
Or what I'm saying

I'm making my choice
But I can't find my voice
Is all that's left is just 
The hope of someone praying?

[pre ch]
When was the last time it felt right
When can I just go outside

[ch2]
Where have my blue skies all gone?
Why is tonight so dark and long?
How does the rain storm sustain more of the pain?

Tell me if this will ever end.
Or when can I expect to mend?
Will I even make it, or break from all the rain?


[v2]
I can't let go
But I can't hold
I've left a mess of things
That I can't even see

[pre-ch2]
Tell me how does this feel right?
Why can't I just go outside?

[ch3]
Where have my blue skies all gone?
