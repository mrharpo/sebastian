[ch] 
(So go on) Make a mistake
Take a new way
Make a new life with me 

It doesn't have to work
It doesn't have to rhyme
As long as you make a mistake with me 

[v1] 
I don't want to take my chances
I'm scared to look before I leap
And there's no way to run for cover
But when I fall, then I'll fall, and I'll be flying free 

[v2] 
I try and try at being better
It never works but I still choose
So help in me believe in me, brother
Cause I believe you believe you try as hard as I do too. 



[br] 
I say that I believe in miracles
The surest things I've never seen
The greatest gift that I have ever been given
Is forgiveness that comes before I need
